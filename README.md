# toggle-hypr-monitors
A lightweight Bash script to toggle the internal laptop monitor (eDP-1) in Hyprland, designed for clamshell setups (lid mostly closed) with an external monitor (DP-1). Tracks state in lid_state.log (0 for disabled, 1 for enabled) and supports manual toggling via a keybinding.
